## Description:

CupboardSwitcher allows players to switch between different types of tool cupboards through an easy-to-use interface. So you don't have to open a server EXTRA at shockbyte.com to get this great TC! Feel free to join my Discord and choose the role Flash. I have a lot of free plugins.
